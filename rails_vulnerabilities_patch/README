Go SECURITY PATCH README
============================

The attached file, go-patch-cve-19mar2013.jar, is a patch that fixes security vulnerability in Ruby on Rails, the framework that powers Go.

Note that this patch is only required for Go server.  The vulnerabilty does not affect Go agents.

------------------------
Pre-requisites
------------------------

* The patch alters the go.jar file present in the Go installation directory
* Please ensure that you run this patch as the user who owns the Go installation directory.
* Note: On Unix, if you've used the RPM or Debian installer, /usr/share/go-server will be owned by root.

------------------------
How to apply this patch
------------------------

Windows

* Identify the directory where Go is installed. Typically this is under "C:\Program files\Go Server". We will refer to this as GO_HOME.
* Stop the Go service from service manager. Open service.msc, locate "Go Server" service and stop it.
* Open command prompt
* Verify 'java' is in PATH. If not, locate the installation of Java, and add the bin directory into PATH.
    If you do not have java installed, you can use the java shipped with Go ("<GO_HOME>\jre\bin")
* Execute: java -jar go-patch-cve-19mar2013.jar "<GO_HOME>\go.jar"
* Start the Go service from service manager. Open service.msc, locate "Go Server" service and start it.

Linux and  Solaris 

* Identify the directory where Go is installed. Typically in "/usr/share/go-server". We will refer to this as GO_HOME.
* Stop the server by executing /etc/init.d/go-server stop
* Open Terminal/Shell
* Verify 'java' is in PATH. If not, locate the installation of Java, and add the bin directory into PATH
* Execute: java -jar go-patch-cve-19mar2013.jar "<GO_HOME>/go.jar"
* Start the server by executing /etc/init.d/go-server start

Mac

* Identify the directory where Go is installed. Typically in "/Applications/Go Server.app"
* Stop the server through the User Interface (clicking on the Go icon)
* Open Terminal/Shell
* Verify 'java' is in PATH. If not, locate the installation of Java, and add the bin directory into PATH
* Execute: java -jar go-patch-cve-19mar2013.jar "<GO_HOME>/go.jar"
* Start the server by clicking on the "Go Server" icon.


---------------------------
Failure applying patch
---------------------------

* The patch creates a backup of the original go.jar as go.backup.before.patch.<timestamp>.jar in the same directory as go.jar
* In case the patch fails to apply during its operation.
    - Please delete go_explode_dir created during the patching process.
    - Rename the go.backup.before.patch.<timestamp>.jar to go.jar and the server should run as original.
* Please contact Go support (support@thoughtworks.com) in case of any issues.
