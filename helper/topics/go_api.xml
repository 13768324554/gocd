<chapter title="Go API">
	<section title="Introduction">
		
		<p>RESTful APIs offer a convenient way to integrate networked systems. Go provides a RESTful API through which you can access and manipulate various kinds of resources. Artifacts, Properties and configurations are the kinds of resources that are available in this version of the API. The following sections will walk you through the various resources and the operations that are supported on each of them.</p>
		<subsection title="Go API features">
			The Go API provides access to various kinds of resources in Go over HTTP. The standard HTTP operation of GET, POST and PUT and DELETE are used to support read, create and upload operations on them. All Go APIs use HTTP basic authentication. Hence performing a GET operation for Artifacts would be the equivalent of getting that resource, performing a PUT would be the equivalent of updating that artifact; and so on.
