<chapter title="Publishing artifacts">
  <p>When executing a job on an agent there are often artifacts created that we need to keep around.
      For example, JUnit creates xml reports that Go is able to parse in order to help you <cref topic="dev_understand_why_build_broken">understand why the build is broken</cref>. You can use Go with any XUnit style xml reports.
      Or you might create a flash video of your UI tests that we want displayed in Go. You can upload any html file from your build and view it in Go.
  </p>
  <p>
    To publish artifacts you add a an <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="artifact">&lt;artifact&gt;</cref> to the job configuration. More information can be found on the <cref topic="managing_artifacts_and_reports">Managing artifacts and reports</cref> page.
