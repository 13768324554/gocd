<chapter title="Re-running Job(s)">
    <p>
        You may sometimes encounter situations where you want to re-run only a subset of jobs within a stage
        rather than the entire stage or pipeline. Examples of such scenarios include:
    </p>
    <bullets>
        <item>Environmental problems on a particular agent caused a job to fail</item>
        <item>Unsuccessful build deployment to one (or more) servers within a cluster of servers</item>
    </bullets>
    <subsection title="To re-run a job">
        <bullets>
            <item>Navigate to the <strong>Stage Details</strong> screen of the stage who's job you want to re-run.</item>
            <item>Click on the <strong>Jobs</strong> tab.</item>
            <item>Check the job(s) you want to re-run and click the <strong>Rerun</strong> button.</item>
        </bullets>
        <note>
            The "Rerun" option is only available for stages that have completed. You cannot re-run jobs for stages
            that are still running.
