<topic title="Pipeline Templates">
    <p>Templating helps to create reusable workflows in order to make tasks like creating and maintaining branches, and managing large number of pipelines easier. </p>
    <subsection title="Creating Pipeline Templates">
        <p> Pipeline Templates can be managed from the Templates tab on the Administration Page. </p>
        <screenshot src="resources/images/cruise/admin/pipeline_templates.png"/>
        <p>
            Clicking on the "Add New Template" brings up the following form which allows you to create a fresh template, or extract it from an existing pipeline.
            Once saved, the pipeline indicated will also start using this newly created template.
        </p>
        <screenshot src="resources/images/cruise/admin/add_new_template.png"/>
        <p>
            A template can also be extracted from a pipeline using the "Extract Template" link. This can be found on the "Pipelines" tab in the Administration page.

    <subsection title="Example">
        <p>As an example, assume that there is a pipeline group called "my-app" and it contains a pipeline called "app-trunk" which builds the application from trunk.
          Now, if we need to create another pipeline called "app-1.0-branch" which builds 1.0 version of the application, we can use Pipeline Templates as follows</p>

        <bullets title="Using Administration UI">
            <item>Create a template "my-app-build" by extracting it from the pipeline "app-trunk", as shown in the previous section.</item>
            <item>Create a new pipeline "app-1.0-branch" which defines SCM material with the branch url and uses the template "my-app-build".</item>
        </bullets>

        <bullets title="Using XML">
            
      <p>Power users can configure the above as follows:</p>

  <pipeline name="app-trunk" template="my-app-build">
    <materials>
      <svn url="http://my-svn-url/trunk" />

  <pipeline name="app-1.0-branch" template="my-app-build">

    <subsection title="Editing Pipeline Templates" id="edit_template">
        <p>Go Administrators can now enable any Go user to edit a template by <cref topic="dev_authorization" anchor="template-admin">making them a template administrator</cref>.</p>
        <p>Template administrators can view and edit the templates to which they have permissions, on the template tab of the admin page.
           Template Administrators, will however not be able to add, delete or change permissions for a template. They will also be able to see the number of pipelines in which the template is being used, but not the details of those pipelines.</p>
