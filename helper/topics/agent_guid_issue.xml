<chapter title="Setting up a new agent by cloning an existing agent">

    <section title="Clone the agent">
        <p>
            An easy way to set up a new agent is to clone an existing one which is already set up and is known to work correctly. You can
            clone an agent in a couple different ways:
        </p>
        <bullets>
            <item>Copy the entire agent directory structure to a new location (can be on the same machine or on a different one).</item>
            <item>If you use a virtual machine to run your agent, clone the entire VM.</item>
        </bullets>
    </section>

    <section title="Remove duplicate GUID">
        <p>
            Once the agent has been cloned, you'll need to delete the GUID file so that Go server does not confuse the new agent for the old
            one. The GUID file can be found at <i>[agent working dir]/config/guid.txt</i> - delete this file from the new agent.
        </p>
    </section>
    
    <section title="Approve the new agent">
        <p>
            You may now start your agent and it should appear under the Agents tab on the Go server. Approve it as you would any new agent
            and you're ready to go.
        </p>
