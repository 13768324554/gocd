    <section title="Introduction">
        <note>The Go API documented here is a work in progress. Future versions may change this API.</note>

    <section title="Stage Cancellation API" collapsed="false" id="stage_cancel">
        <p>
            This API provides the ability to cancel an active stage of a pipeline.
            The API needs the name of the pipeline and name of the stage to perform cancellation.
        </p>
        <p>Security Note: The user invoking the API should have sufficient permission to operate on the pipeline.</p>
        <subsection title="Key">
            <p>
                <strong>POST</strong>
                to
                <strong>URL http://[server]:8153/go/api/stages/[pipelineName]/[stageName]/cancel</strong>

        <subsection title="Examples">
            <bullets>
                <item>We use curl, a command line tool to demonstrate the use of the API, in the following examples. Of course, you can use any HTTP client library.</item>
                <item>We assume that the URL of the Go server is<strong>http://goserver.com:8153/</strong>.
                </item>
                <item>We assume security has been switched on, and that there is a user named
                    <strong>jez</strong>
                    with the password<strong>badger</strong>.
                </item>
            </bullets>
            <p>Assuming the pipeline configuration looks like:</p>
            <code>

                    .... ]]>
            </code>
            <p>Run this command to cancel the stage of the pipeline:</p>
