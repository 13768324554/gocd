<chapter title="Ensure only one instance of a pipeline can run at the same time">
    <p>Sometimes you want to ensure that only a single instance of a pipeline can run at a time.
       This is important if the stages of a pipeline are interrelated. For example the first stage may set
        up an environment that is used by the next stage in the pipeline.</p>
    <p>If a pipeline is locked then Go will not allow any other instance of that pipeline to be
        scheduled until the currently running one has been completed.</p>
<p> To enable locking from the Config UI, navigate to the General Options section of pipeline.</p>

<img src="resources/images/cruise/admin/pipeline_locking.png" />
<p> To enable locking from the Config XML set the isLocked attribute to true</p>
  

        <code>
<![CDATA[
<pipeline name="my-locked-pipeline" isLocked="true" >
    <materials>
        ...
    </materials>
    <stages>
        ...
    </stages>
</pipeline>
]]>
        </code>
