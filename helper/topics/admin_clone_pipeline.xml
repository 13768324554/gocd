 <chapter title="Clone an existing pipeline">
    <p>Clone pipeline functionality helps you create a new pipeline from an existing pipeline by giving it a new name. Typically when setting up a pipeline for a new branch, it is very useful to take
        an existing pipeline and clone it.
    </p>
    <p>If the user is a pipeline group admin, she can clone the new pipeline into a group that she has access to. If the user is an admin she can clone the pipeline into any group or give a new group name,
    in which case the group gets created.</p>
