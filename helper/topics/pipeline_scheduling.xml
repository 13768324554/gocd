<topic title="Pipeline Scheduling">
	<p>Pipelines get scheduled automatically by default. Please see the knowledge base article in the Also see section below. Here we'll see how to disable automatic scheduling.</p>

	<subsection title="Disable automatic scheduling">
	Unchecking the "Automatic Pipeline Scheduling" checkbox above disables auto scheduling. Actually this is the same as marking first stage as manual. We have just surfaced the option at a pipeline level to make it easier to spot. Please note though that this isn't really a pipeline level configuration. For example, if this is pipeline is based off a template, the checkbox above will be grayed out to indicate that it can only be toggled by editing the first stage in the template.
