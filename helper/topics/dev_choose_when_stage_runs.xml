<chapter title="Choose when a stage runs">
  <p>Often there are steps in your <cref topic="concepts_in_go">pipeline</cref> that you do not want to happen automatically. For example, you might want to keep binaries from being created for every pipeline (to prevent <cref topic="admin_out_of_disk_space">running out of disk space</cref>) or want to choose when your code is <cref topic="rm_deploy_to_environment">deployed to production</cref>. Stages in Go can be marked as 'manual' just for this purpose.</p>
  <hint>You can create a manual pipeline by setting the first stage to manual.</hint>
  <section title="Example usage">
    <p>Usage: We need a manual 'dist' stage that will create the binaries used by later stages.</p>
    <bullets>
      <item><cref topic="admin_add_stage">Add a new stage</cref> named 'dist' after a build stage</item>
      <item>Set the Stage type to manual</item>

      <item>Now, when the build stage 'build' is completed, you can manually cause Go to create the binary from the <cref topic="pipeline_activity_page">Pipeline activity</cref> page</item>
