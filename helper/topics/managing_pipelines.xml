<chapter title="Managing pipelines">
    <p>Go can be configured using
        <cref topic="administration_page">Administration</cref>
        Tab. You can perform operations like add/edit Pipelines, Stages, Jobs, Tasks, Templates and Pipeline group. You can also configure Go by editing the full XML file if you
        wish, by clicking on the
        <strong>Config XML</strong>
        section of the
        <cref topic="administration_page">Administration</cref>
        tab. Go will check the syntax of the configuration before it saves it again

    <section title="Stage approvals in action" collapsed="true">
        <p>By default, when one stage completes successfully, the next stage is automatically triggered by Go. However sometimes you don't want the next stage to be triggered
            automatically. This might be the case if you have a stage that deploys your application to a testing, staging or production environment. Another case can be when you
            don't want your pipeline to be automatically triggered by changes in version control. In these situations, you want the stage triggered by manual intervention. This can
            be done through manual <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="approval">approvals</cref>.
        </p>
        <p>If you add a manual approval to the first stage in a pipeline, it will prevent the pipeline from being triggered from version control. Instead, it will only pick up
            changes when you trigger the pipeline manually (this is sometimes known as "forcing the build").
        </p>
        <p>From Cruise 1.1 (legacy version of Go), you can control who can trigger manual approvals. See the section on
            <cref topic="dev_authorization" anchor="approvals">Adding authorization to approvals</cref>
            for more details.

    <section title="Managing pipeline groups" collapsed="true">
        <p>Starting with Cruise 1.3 (legacy version of Go), there is support for collecting multiple pipelines into a single named group. See the section
            on
            <cref topic="dev_authorization" anchor="pipeline-groups">Specifying who can view and operate pipeline groups</cref>
            for more details.
