<chapter title="Delegating Group Administration">
    <p>
        A Go Administrator can authorize users and roles to be administrators for Pipeline Groups. These group
        administrators have certain privileges which are explained in the section "Privileges of a Group
        Administrator".
    </p>
    <section title="Steps to assign Group Administrators">
        <p>
            To assign a user as a group administrator:
        </p>
        <steps>
            <item>Click on "Pipelines" tab on the <strong>Admin</strong> section</item>
            <item>Locate the group you want to assign a group administrator to</item>
            <item>Click the "Edit" link for that group</item>
            <item>Here, you can define permissions for users and roles</item>
        </steps>
        <screenshot src="resources/images/cruise/group_admin_permissions.png" />
        <p>
            In the above screenshot, the Go admin has delegated group admin privileges to a user "jez" and all
            users defined under the role "groupAdminRole". The privileges of a Group Administrator have been
            described in the next section.
        </p>
        <p>
            For power users, here's how you'd assign the same permissions via Config XML:
        </p>
        <code>
            <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="pipelines">&lt;pipelines</cref> group="studios"&gt; &nbsp;
     <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="group_authorization">&lt;authorization&gt;</cref>&nbsp;
         <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="group_admins">&lt;admins&gt;</cref>&nbsp;
            <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="user">&lt;user&gt;</cref> jez &lt;/user&gt;&nbsp;
            <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="role">&lt;role&gt;</cref> groupAdminRole &lt;/role&gt;&nbsp;
         &lt;/admins&gt;
     &lt;/authorization&gt;
     <cref topic="configuration_reference" anchor="pipeline">&lt;pipeline</cref> name="go_pipeline"&gt; &nbsp;
     ...
     &lt;/pipeline&gt;
&lt;/pipelines&gt;
        </code>

    </section>

    <section title="Privileges of a Group Administrator">
        <p>As a group administrator of a pipeline group, a user is privileged to:</p>
        <bullets>
            <item>View and operate (trigger, rerun stages etc.) all the pipelines in this group.</item>
            <item>Add other group admins to this group</item>
            <item>Authorize users/roles with 'view' and 'operate' permissions for this pipeline group.</item>
            <item>Add and Delete pipelines to/from the group.</item>
            <item>Add a pipeline using the "Add New Pipeline" wizard, but only to the groups he is allowed to administer.</item>
            <item>Edit pipelines belonging to the group. Which includes renaming, adding, deleting and modifying stages and jobs.</item>
            <item>Restfully view and operate (trigger, rerun stages etc.) all the pipelines in this group.</item>
            <item>Restfully edit the pipelines belonging to this group.</item>
        </bullets>
        <note>
            <strong>Note:</strong> A group administrator can access "Pipelines" and "Config XML" tabs on the
            Administration page to <cref topic="pipeline_group_admin_config">view and edit his/her pipeline groups</cref>. He/She cannot access Server Configuration or perform
            user management. While a group administrator cannot access Pipeline Templates either, they can use
            existing templates for pipelines within their pipeline group.
