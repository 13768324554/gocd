<chapter title="Notifications">
  <p>It is often useful to receive an email when certain status changes occur in a stage. For example, a developer might want to know when their own check-in has broken the build. Alternatively, a manager might want an email whenever a project is deployed into production. Both of these scenarios can be covered by Notification Filters</p>
  <note>Notifications will only work if <cref topic="dev_authentication">Security</cref> is enabled and <cref topic="admin_mailhost_info">mailhost information</cref> is correct.</note>
  <section title="Example usage">
    <p>Usage: As a developer, I want to be notified when I break the build.</p>

      <item>When I check in, my source control log in will be either "ChrisT" or "CT", so enter both of those into the "My check-in aliases" box</item>
