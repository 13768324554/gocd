<chapter title="Compare Builds">
    <p>
        Go allows you to compare any two builds of a pipeline and see exactly what changes happened between those
        two instances. The information in this view will include:
    </p>
    <bullets>
        <item>Code checkins</item>
        <item>Upstream pipelines</item>
        <item>Story/defect numbers (when linked to a tracking tool)</item>
    </bullets>

    <section title="Accessing Pipeline Compare">
        <p>
            There are several locations from where the Pipeline Compare feature can be invoked. These include:
        </p>
        <bullets>
            <item>Pipelines Dashboard page (the "Compare" link in each pipeline)</item>
            <item>Environments page</item>
            <item>Stage Details page</item>
            <item>Stage History widget within the Stage Details page</item>
        </bullets>
    </section>

    <section title="Understanding the Pipeline Compare Screen">
        <p>
            The Pipeline Compare screen lets you compare any two instances of a pipeline. Every pipeline instance
            is associated with a set of changes; be it a source control modification or an upstream pipeline.
            Performing a compare lets you easily identify exactly what these changes were.

                <strong>To/from search box:</strong>
                You can search for the appropriate pipeline instance using any of the following - pipeline label,
                check-in comment, person who checked in, upstream pipeline label and revision.
            </item>
            <item>
                <strong>Upstream dependency changes:</strong>
                All the changes to upstream pipelines within the search range.
            </item>
            <item>
                <strong>Changes to version control systems:</strong>
                All check-ins that went into dependent VCS materials within the search range.
            </item>
            <item>
                <strong>Tracking tool integration:</strong>
                If you've configured a <cref topic="go_integration" anchor="tracking_tool">tracking tool
                integration</cref> for this pipeline or any upstream pipelines, check-in comments containing
                story/defect/ticket numbers would be hyperlinked to the appropriate tracking tool.
            </item>
        </steps>

    <section title="Using Pipeline History">
        <p>
            You can also select a pipeline by browsing the pipeline history.
        </p>
	<screenshot alttext="Pipeline Compare - Timeline" src="resources/images/cruise/compare_timeline.png"/>
	<p> Steps to select a particular instance from the history:</p>
