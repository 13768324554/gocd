<chapter title="Artifact integrity verification">
	<section title="Overview">
		<p>Go verifies artifact integrity to ensure that they are unchanged from the point of origin. While executing a job, Go applies the following rules if the checksum of the downloaded artifact does not match the checksum at the time of generation of the artifact.</p>
		<bullets>
			<item>If the artifact was uploaded using the artifact API, a warning is displayed in the console output for the job</item>
			<item>If the downloaded artifact is different from the point of generation, the job will be failed with an error in the console output for the job.</item>
			<item>If Go is unable to fetch the original checksum for the downloaded artifact, a warning is displayed in the console output for the job. </item>
		
		</bullets>
		<p> Users who download artifacts for a job from the artifacts tab on the dashboard can verify their integirty by using the md5.checksum file within the cruise-output folder available on same tab. The file contains the name and checksum for each artifact saved by the job.</p>
