<chapter title="Run a Job on a group of Agents">
    <p>Sometimes there is a particular job that you may wish to run on all agents in an environment, or in all agents
        that
        match a certain resource tag. For example you may want to run a system update on all linux agents, or install a
        new piece of software.
    </p>
    
    <p>Go will run the Job on all agents that match the environment and resources specified in the job.</p>
    <p>If an agent is missing or lost contact, a job will be scheduled. When the agent comes back on line, the job will
        be re-scheduled.
    </p>
    <p>Jobs are given a unique name based on the name of the job in the configuration file and the UUID of the agent
        on which it runs. So for example, if the job is called 'run-upgrades' and you have two agents, you would see
        jobs
        like 'run-upgrades-81b23d04-9970-44f5-8973-c70bfd7c9e67' and
        'run-upgrades-9356e9d4-3a90-447d-bb74-2045aa355ef4'.
