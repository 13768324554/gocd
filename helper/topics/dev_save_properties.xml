<chapter title="Saving properties about a build">
  <p>When building your code, there can be quite a bit of extra information that you are interested in. For example, you might run <exref url="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA</exref> on your code in order to log code coverage. With properties, you can save this information, and even look at the history of a property (by way of an exported spreadsheet).</p>
  <section title="Example usage">
    <p>Usage: As a developer, I want to save the average <exref url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity</exref> of a function (pulled from <exref url="http://www.kclee.de/clemens/java/javancss/">JavaNCSS</exref>).</p>
    <p>For this example, we're going to take the information out of "target/javancss/javancss_metrics_util.xml"</p>
    <bullets>
      <item>On the <cref topic="administration_page">Administration Tab</cref>, edit the job that should generate the properties</item>
      <item>Ensure the following "properties" block is in the job configuration</item>
      <img src="resources/images/cruise/dev/save_properties/2_properties_config.png" />
      <item>Now, after that job has run, you should have extra properties information on the <cref topic="job_details_page">Job Details</cref> page</item>
      <img src="resources/images/cruise/dev/save_properties/3_view_property.png" />
      <item>You can export the property history as a CSV file</item>
