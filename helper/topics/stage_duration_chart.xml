    <section title="Stage Duration Chart">
        <p>Go provides a chart on the stage details page which can be used for trend analysis of the stage's periodic runs. This graph shows two line graphs, one each for passed and failed stage instances
            which are plotted using the total duration of the last 300 stage instances.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To navigate to the Graphs:</strong>
            <steps>
                <item>Click on the stage bar of the relevant stage on the pipelines dashboard.</item>
                <item>Click on the tab 'Graphs'.</item>
            </steps>
        </p>
