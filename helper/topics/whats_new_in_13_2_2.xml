                Microsoft TFS SDK downgrade - the TFS SDK was upgraded from v10.1 to v11.0 in Go 13.2.1 but a few customers reported that their TFS material updates started failing intermittently.
                It looks like there was a <exref url="https://bitbucket.org/stellaritysoftware/tfs-repository-plugin/issue/11/memory-leak-in-tfs-sdk">memory leak in TFS SDK v11.0</exref>,
                therefore we are reverting to TFS SDK v10.1 with this minor release of Go to take the time and investigate the issue further.
